# Installation

If you are running raspbian (So pretty much the raspberry pi), get the rasbpian .sh file, if you are running any armhf based device
(Like the TX1, TK1, or Beagle Bone), then get the armhf .sh file.

For raspbian based devices:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGuyWhoCodes/FRC-Vision-Maker/master/vision-raspbian.sh
```
For armhf based devices:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheGuyWhoCodes/FRC-Vision-Maker/master/vision-armhf.sh
```


then once you have the .sh file, run the command:

```sh
chmod +x vision-VERSION.sh
```
